# IGVC2018
Let's get started with our Gazebo Simulation!

Here's some packages you need to install aside from ROS/Gazebo:

Gmapping: ```sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-slam-gmapping```\
Turtlebot: ```sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-turtlebot```\
Map_server: ```sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-map-server```\
Amcl: ```sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-amcl```\
Move_base: ```sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-move-base```

Run the following commands to setup your workspace:

``mkdir -p ~/mybot_ws/src\
cd ~/mybot_ws/src\
git clone -b simulation https://github.com/ut-ras/IGVC2018.git\
cd ..\
catkin_make\
source devel/setup.bash``

Check that you have sourced properly:
```echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH /home/youruser/catkin_ws/src:/opt/ros/kinetic/share```

Mapping your first environment:

``roslaunch mybot_gazebo mybot_world.launch\
roslaunch mybot_navigation gmapping_demo.launch\
roslaunch mybot_description mybot_rviz_gmapping.launch\
roslaunch mybot_navigation mybot_teleop.launch``

Drive around until the map is deemed satisfactoryâ€¦
DOONT close the gazebo/rviz stuff yet:

``mkdir -p ~/mybot_ws/src/mybot_navigation/maps\
rosrun map_server map_saver -f ~/mybot_ws/src/mybot_navigation/maps/test_map``

Save rviz file if you want.
It would go inside: ~/mybot_ws/src/mybot_description/rviz

Steps to use AMCL package:

``roslaunch mybot_gazebo mybot_world.launch\
roslaunch mybot_navigation amcl_demo.launch\
roslaunch mybot_description mybot_rviz_amcl.launch``

Under Rviz tools at the top, click 2D Nav Goal then click and hold wherever you want!
